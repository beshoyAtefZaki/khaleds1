## Asset Movement

In ERPNext, you can track the location of an asset or to whom it is issued. For that, you need to create a Asset Movement transaction, whenever the asset is moved from one location to another. You can also keep a track to issuance of the asset to any employee.

There is also a dedicated button "Transfer Asset" inside the Asset form to initiate the Asset Movement.
