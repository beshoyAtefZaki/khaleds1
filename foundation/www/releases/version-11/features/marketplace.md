# Marketplace

Our announcement in the 2017 Conference, that we are planning to launch an in-app listing of products by ERPNext users, is finally coming to life. ERPNext Version 11 will have a free marketplace where any ERPNext user can list their products and be discovered by thousands of other companies using ERPNext.

The marketplace itself will be hosted independently by the ERPNext Foundation, a registered not-for-profit that works towards the improvement of ERPNext.

With the marketplace ERPNext goes beyond a tool to help manage a business, to a tool that also helps you grow your business.

### Marketplace Design

The marketplace will be available as an in-app module within ERPNext
